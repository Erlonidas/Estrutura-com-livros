# Estrutura-com-livros
Lib implemented to organize and save books, like a library

The Python code contains some suggested functions in a project that involves saving information about books.
The books are stored in a dictionary, where the key is the ISBN number of the book, and the value of each key is book information, 
such as the title, genre, and author. These values are stored in tuple format.
